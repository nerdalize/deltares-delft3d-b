Please run "test_snctools.m".  These produce a lot of very verbose
output.  Don't be fooled by any of it, if any tests fail, you will
know.

In order to test java functionality with OPeNDAP, you should set
both of these preferences.

    >> setpref('SNCTOOLS','USE_JAVA',true);
    >> setpref('SNCTOOLS','TEST_REMOTE',true);

If you wish to test reading netCDF files via HTTP (not the same as 
OPeNDAP), then in addition to USE_JAVA and TEST_REMOTE, you must set
another preference.

    >> setpref('SNCTOOLS','TEST_HTTP',true);

HDF4 and GRIB2 support is still a bit experimental, so these tests
are not enabled by default.  To run them, set the following preference

    >> setpref('SNCTOOLS','TEST_HDF4',true);
    >> setpref('SNCTOOLS','TEST_GRIB2',true);
