!
!   Checks how a piece of line of dry points, thin dams, e.g., is located
!   w.r.t. subdomain, and if partly inside, adjust that piece of line to
!   fit within subdomain
!
!!--pseudo code and references--------------------------------------------------
!
!   first, check whether piece of line is completely inside subdomain
!   if not, next check whether it is completely outside subdomain
!      if so, then do nothing
!      otherwise, piece of line is partly inside subdomain
!         this piece of line needs to be cut off to fit within subdomain
!         three types of lines are distinguished:
!
!            line is horizontal
!            or line is vertical
!            or angle of line and x-axis is 45, 135, 225 or 315 degrees
!
!              if angle is 45 or 225 degrees (i.e. if m1<m2 then n1<n2)
!
!                 case 1: start point is left, end point is right
!
!                   if start point is outside subdomain then move it to boundary
!                   else if end point is outside subdomain then move it to boundary
!
!                 case 2: start point is right, end point is left
!
!                   if end point is outside subdomain then move it to boundary
!                   else if start point is outside subdomain then move it to boundary
!

!
!                 case 1: start point is left, end point is right
