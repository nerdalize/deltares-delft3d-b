c           given  the row and column numbers find the location of the
c        number (ijloc) in the matrix array.  if there is no entry,
c        exit with iflag non zero and ijloc as the location into which
c        to insert the entry after the other values have been pushed
c        down.
c           if i=0, find the first and last locations for column j
c           ijloc will have the first location and iflag the last
c           the entries are stored in ascending order of j.  the order
c        of i within j is immaterial.
c           if j has no entries and i equals zero, set ijloc = 0
c           if j has no entries and i not equal zero, set ijloc equal
c        to current value.
