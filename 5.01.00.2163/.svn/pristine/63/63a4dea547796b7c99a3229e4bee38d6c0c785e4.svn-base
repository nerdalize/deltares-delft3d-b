%WEIR Read/write a weir file.
%   NOTE: This routine has been superseded by D3D_ATTRIB. It has been
%   included for backward compatibility.
%
%   W = WEIR('read',FILENAME) reads the specified file and returns a
%   structure W with fields depending on the content of the file.
%
%   WEIR('write',FILENAME,W) writes the data of structure W to a file with
%   name FILENAME. The structure should specify the file type and include
%   the fields specified for that particular file type indicated above.
