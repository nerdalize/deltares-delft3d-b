<h2>Introduction</h2>
ESM and FSM are libraries for C and Fortran, respectively, that provide
easy access to shared memory using a named "key" space.&nbsp; ESM is an
acronym for Easy Shared Memory. FSM is for Fortran Shared memory.&nbsp;
Programs using ESM/FSM can allocate space for variables and assign a
character-string name to the space that can be used by another process
to get the address of the variable. ESM/FSM variables can range from
single characters, integers or reals to much larger data structures.<br>
<br>
Both libraries use the notion of a "context" to group related
variables.&nbsp; By default, contexts are in placed in shared memory,
that is, UNIX SVR4 shared memory, so that several processes on the same
host can access the variables.&nbsp; A flag can be given that uses
"local" memory instead of shared memory.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is useful
when lightweight processes (also known as threads) are used.&nbsp;
Shared memory is not implemented on the Microsoft Windows platform.<br>
<br>
FSM is based on the Deltares' FMM (Fortran Memory
Management).&nbsp; FMM was created around 1990 to provide dynamic
memory management for Fortran-77.&nbsp; FSM has the same API (with a
few extensions) as FMM for backward compatibility.&nbsp; FSM is built
on top of ESM.&nbsp; Since Fortran-95 provides native memory
management, FSM is not recommended for use in new programs, unless
shared memory is required.<br>
<br>
ESM has been changed radically since the 3.0 version.&nbsp; In
particular, the API calls have changed, and threads are now properly
supported.<br>
